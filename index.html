<h3>Food Waste in America</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.usda.gov/oce/foodwaste/faqs.htm">United States Department of Agriculture, Office of the Chief Economist</a>, America wastes around 30 to 40 percent of its food supply. In 2010, this loss surmounted to around 133 billion pounds, and $161 billion worth of food wasted. But food waste isn't just a problem in Americaâ€“ it's a global issue. According to the <a href="http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/en/">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</a> one third of all food produced globally is lost or wasted every year.</p>

<p>All of this taken into account, it is important to note that there is a speicifc terminology that one uses to refer to food waste and food loss in general</p>

<div class="containcontain">
<div class="thing">
<h4>Food Loss</h4>
<p>Unintentional reductions in food quantity or quality before consumption, including postharvest losses.</p>
</div>

<div class="thingtwo">
<h4>Food Loss + Food Waste</h4>
<p>Deliberately discarded food that is fit for human consumption</p>
</div>

<div class="thing">
<h4>Food Loss + Food Waste + Potential Food Loss</h4>
<p>Crops lost before harvest to pests and disease or left in the field,
crops lost due to poor harvesting techniques or sharp price
drops, or food that was not produced because of a lack of
appropriate agricultural inputs</p>

<p>The one that consumers should be most worried about is "food loss + food waste."</p>
