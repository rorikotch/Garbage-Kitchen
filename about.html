<p>Garbage Kitchen was created and developed at the University of Miami as a part of the School of Communication's Interactive Media M.F.A. program by <a href="http://www.rorikotch.com/" target="_blank">Rori Kotch</a>. Over the course of a semester, all recipes were developed, cooked, documented &amp; more.</p>

  <h2>The Process</h2>
</section>
</div>
<div class="item">
<section>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>The first part of the process was creating a concept map of the entire site to see how things could be related. While creating my concept map I was able to explore new ideas and concepts that I may not have thought of if I just went straight into the human-centered design process. Once I completed my concept map I created a sitemap to map out all of the content of the website and plan out the information architecture of the site.</p>

</div>
<div class="item">

  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <p>The second step of the process was to complete a competitive analysis of other websites and companies that have a similar idea or mission. I completed my competitive analysis using a google sheet. To view the full competitive analysis <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pqLSUpyq7MD-NGxweWhlSNdQyn6rWDte8xzcB_4tZGA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

</section>
</div>
<div class="item">
<section>
  <h3>Step 3</h3>
  <p>After completing the competitive analysis I was able to move onto task flows. Task flows helped me determine the flow of the website as a whole and what tools I needed to develop in the future.</p>
</section>
</div>
<div class="item">
<section>
  <h3>Step 4 &amp; 5</h3>
  <p>Once my task flows were complete I was able to start sketching. Sketching helped me ideate even further, which is always good. The low-fidelity wireframes show the bare bones of the site and its structure, they are pictured below.</p>

  <img src="media/about/About.jpg" class="wireframe" alt="this is an image of the wireframe for the about page"/>
</section>
</div>
<div class="item">
<section>
  <h3>Step 6</h3>
  <p>After low-fidelity wireframes were complete I started coding the site! The first step of the coding process was to purchase a domain name (I used <a href="namecheap.com">NameCheap</a>.) I linked my Github to my domain using Github pages and then I was able to code away!</p>

</div>
<div class="item">
<section>
  <h3>Step 7</h3>
  <p>Once I started coding the site and developing the idea further, I continued with my recipe testing. Each recipe was tested twice and was recorded and video teaped each time. When the recipes were completed I had friends and family try them, only recipes with a positive response made it on the site.</p>
</section>
</div>
<div class="item">
<section>
  <h3>Step 8</h3>
  <p>After all recipes were tested and developed, I was able to start editing all the videos and photos taken during the process. Photos were all edited using Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop. All videos were edited using iMovie.</p>

  <h3>Step 9</h3>
  <p>Upon the completion of researching, developing recipes, documenting the reciepes &amp; coding the site I was able to complete usability testing. All usability testing was completed in person. For this process I had to make participant packets and moderator packets and schedule out times that were convenient for all participants. A total of five user tests were completed for the website and two in-person recipe tests were held with participants. In-person recipe tests included watching participants recreate recipes from the website and hearing about the process from the participant's point-of-view. The recipes that were tested by the users included the <a href="mash.html" target="-_blank">Broccoli &amp; Cauliflower Mash</a> &amp; <a href="gingertea.html" target="_blank">Ginger Tea</a>. Both participants were pleased with the instructions provided and the layout of the recipes page. One participant used their mobile phone to read the recipe and the other used a laptop.</p>
