  <h2>The Process</h2>
</section>

<section>
<p>The first part of the process was creating a concept map of the entire site to see how things could be related. While creating my concept map I was able to explore new ideas and concepts that I may not have thought of if I just went straight into the human-centered design process</p>
<!--inset a photo of the concept map here-->

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<section>
  <p>The second step of the process was to complete a competitive analysis of other websites and companies that have a similar idea or mission. I completed my competitive analysis using a google sheet. To view the full competitive analysis <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pqLSUpyq7MD-NGxweWhlSNdQyn6rWDte8xzcB_4tZGA/edit?usp=sharing">click here</a>.</p>
